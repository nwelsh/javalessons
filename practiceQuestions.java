// Question 1: what is the difference between instance variables and local variables 
// instance variables are accessible by all methods in the class 
class Athlete {
public String athleteName; // these are instance 
public double athleteSpeed;
public int athleteAge;
}
//local varibales are present within a block, function, or constructor and can only be accessed inside that
public void athlete() {
String athleteName; // these are local 
double athleteSpeed;
int athleteAge;
}
